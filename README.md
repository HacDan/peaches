# peaches

peaches is a general purpose workflow organization tool for the terminal.
It was primarily built for my own personal common actions, and leverages common linux tools such as `ripgrep` and `tmux`.

## Installation

peaches is built to run on linux primarily.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KCaverly/peaches/main/install.sh -O - | sh
```

## Upgrade

To upgrade peaches to the latest version, please run `upgrade`.

```sh
peaches upgrade
```

This command will grab the latest install script from github, and update the version installed.
